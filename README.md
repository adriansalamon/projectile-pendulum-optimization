# projectile-pendulum-optimization

Made as a fun side-project in physics. Optimizes at at what angle you should "cut" a pendelum rod/string in order to launch a projectile as far as possible. The angle depends on the length of the string of the pendelum and the height of the pivot point over the ground.
